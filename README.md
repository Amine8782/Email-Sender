Increase Email Spam Bypass     - The script uses randomized SMTP server, subject, message, name, link for sending emails to increase the chances of bypassing spam filters.     Flexible Sending Speed     - The script allows you to select the sending speed mode - either slow (with a delay between sending emails) or fast (using multiple threads).
